    </ul>

    <p>
      probably should look at some different ways to analyse audio too. Anyone
      has a suggestion?

      Special thanks to @superGuiGui for his
      <a href="https://github.com/superguigui/threejs-starter-kit">starterkit</a
      >, which I use as a base.
    </p>

    <p>
      And super special thanks to all the artists producing music everyday. I
      give props and only take small samples from a song, but if you want
      something removed please contact me.
    </p>

    <p>
      see <a href="http://instagram.com/flowen_af">my Instagram</a> for more
      work.

    <h2 id="quickhowto">Quick howto:</h2>

    <p>After cloning or download install all node dependencies:</p>

    <pre><code class="bash language-bash">npm i
        </code></pre>

    <p>Then launch the main task to open budo livereload server:</p>

    <pre><code class="bash language-bash">npm start
        </code></pre>

    <p>to build the project:</p>

    <pre><code class="bash language-bash">npm run build
        </code></pre>

    <p>
      For some reason the build command doesn’t work so instead I manually
      copy-paste this in CLI:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="bash language-bash">browserify -v -d src/index.js -t babelify -t glslify | uglifyjs &gt; index.js
        </code></pre>

    <h1 id="whatisxenochiku">what is xenochiku?</h1>

    <p>The answer is 吃苦, transliterated chi ku.</p>

    <p>
      In English, this Chinese expression is known as eating bitter. I have
      found no better explication on the Web than this post on a martial arts
      forum:
    </p>

    <p>
      Chinese phrase for enduring hardship. Or as Occidentals would say: "Grin
      and Bear It." Other references are: “Keep on Truckin”, “Hang In There”,
      “Stick It Out”, “Suck It Up”, etc., all to mean to endure something
      unpleasant in good humor. Or to continue despite difficulties in a general
      phrase of encouragement meaning to stay focused.
    </p>

    <p>and</p>

    <p>
      Eating bitter seems to be an aged-old saying, like a parent to a child,
      upon having the child do something without complaint. It has the meaning
      of working hard and tolerate some agony in order to acquire what it is one
      is hoping to achieve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given the rapidity with which Chinese culture is spreading in the West, we
      will see eating bitter  become more and more common. A biography published
      in 2010 (not a translation but a book originally in English) has Eating
      Bitter as its title, and there are many more examples.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know, some of you will say it's too early to declare eating bitter part
      of the English language. Well, maybe you still have to put it between
      inverted commas and explain it upon first mention. I do believe, however,
      we will see it entering into common circulation soon. This is because (1)
      none of the English-language phrases*, from "grin and bear it" to "suck it
      up", carry quite the same connotations and (2) its very Chinese-ness makes
      it attractive, just as "tiger mom" filled a lacuna that had existed
      before.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, you can say "I am used to eating bitter" or "I am one who likes to eat
      bitter, as we say at home" to describe yourself. In a job interview, this
      may get you a quizzical look, which is an opportunity for you to tell
      more. Interest in things Chinese is high in the West, so ride the wave!
